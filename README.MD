# Geolocation Data Analysis

This project is based on Machine Learning algorithm KMeans clustering
to group location/geolocation based on the student's tase and their situation.

In a fast moving world, everyone has to move away from their comfort of home, and find a suitable place to stay, this project tries to do that using,
the sample data from 'Kaggle' and 'Foursquare api', and present result on python library 'Folium'.
